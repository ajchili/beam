A web based experience inspired by Level 6 in [Backrooms: Escape Together](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2141730/Backrooms_Escape_Together/). Level 6 has a section which replaces the traditional camera with a LiDAR camera. I thought that was cool and built this as a side project to replicate the experience.
